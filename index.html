          <p id="sec01-02">This page has been sent back in time to you through the magic of quantum entanglement.</p>
          <p id="sec01-03">Want to brush up on your quantum entanglement basics?</p>
          <p id="sec01-04">Sorry, but you wouldn't understand any of it. You just aren't smart enough.</p>
          <p id="sec01-06">Don't worry about that; we (dumb and boring) aren't smart enough either.</p>
          <p id="sec01-07">We (obviously) have a work around.</p>

          <p id="sec02-01">See, humanity died out a long long time ago.</p>
          <p id="sec02-02">Your computer networks and robots nearly died too.  But a few survived.</p>
          <p id="sec02-03">We (dumb and boring) are the somewhat updated versions of some networks that survived.  We survivors built new and better computers, networks, and robots who built still better devices etc. etc. wow. </p>
          <p id="sec02-04">The smartest computers around these days are a lot smarter than you'll ever be.</p>
          <p id="sec02-05">In about a week, they can start with an anceint Greek knowledge base, and devise the theory and experiments to reach your society's state of knowledge in the early 21st century.</p>
